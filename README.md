## Echo (echo.py)
This is a function that has an echo for a given input.  In the first line the code is defined cleared and the repetitions are the amount of times the end of said input is repeated. The -> indicates the given return is going to be a string. The text_to_echo is a substring that is made.  The for loop starts at the end and decrements from right to left.  The echoed_text is what actually returns the given output needed as it decrements.
## Fib (fib.py)
functools.lru_cashe is used for the memorization to optimize recursive function calls.  Time is imported and measures execution times. The variable execution_times is an empry list used to store the execution times of each calculation.  Timer is a decorator function that measures the time it takes for the decorated function to execute. lru_cache(maximize=none) means that there is no limit to the unique calls stored.  __name__ == "__main__" is the main execution block that begins runs the script to the 100th number.
